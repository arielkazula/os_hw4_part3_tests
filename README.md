# OS HW4 Part 3 Tests
##Setup:
Copy your malloc_3.cpp to the folder  
Copy the metadata struct to the start of test.cpp (**without changing Anything in your struct**)   
(Replace the one there now)  
run using cmake

##Notes
I will keep updating the test  
if you can help and want to add your tests create a pull request

**The tests will only work if you use a metadata list like they said in the file
(i know it's not the only way but that the way my tests work)**
